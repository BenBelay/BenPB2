### What has been done:

I have chosen 2 people on my course to collaborate with on a group project. After discussion, the current task is to create an iOS mobile app that wirelessly connects to an Arduino with an integrated WiFi module and controls a separate device - a robot. We have decided to learn how to code in Swift, as well as learn how to use an Arduino and connect one to an iOS application.

### What have I learned:

I have not learned anything yet, but I have collated useful information such as YouTube tutorials and an online course, preparing myself to learn the basics of Swift. Using a Windows operating system would mean I must install macOS on a virtual machine.

### Any changes to my goal:

No changes have been made to this goal yet.

### Next steps to achieve my goals:

I must now prepare by using the resources gathered to get a better understanding on the skill I am learning. I will also need to create a plan, laying out my goals; I will be using the tool Notion to collect all of my information. I will need to purchase an Arduino and learn how to create a simple servo-powered robot with it.
